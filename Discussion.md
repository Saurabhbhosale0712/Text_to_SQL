### ✅ 1. **SQLCoder** (Best Open-Source for SQL)

* **Why Use**:

  * Fine-tuned specifically on **SQL generation tasks**
  * Accurate with real-world schema
  * Open-source and hosted on Hugging Face
* **Why Not**:

  * Needs GPU (7B parameters)
  * Slower on free Colab, especially without quantization

✅ **Recommended if you're using Google Colab with free GPU**

---

### ✅ 2. **Text2SQL-T5** (`tscholak/2sql`)

* **Why Use**:

  * Based on T5, fine-tuned for SQL translation
  * Works on CPU (lightweight)
  * Good for small to medium datasets
* **Why Not**:

  * Slightly less accurate than SQLCoder or GPT-3.5
  * Handles simple queries best

✅ **Recommended if you want speed + free + CPU support**

---

### ⚠️ 3. **StarCoder**

* **Why Use**:

  * Can generate full SQL + docstrings + code
  * Supports multi-language code generation
* **Why Not**:

  * **Not specialized** for SQL
  * Model size is large (\~15B), so needs strong GPU or quantization
  * May generate extra non-SQL text

⚠️ **Recommended only for advanced use with powerful GPU**

---

### ❌ 4. **OpenAI GPT (gpt-3.5 / gpt-4)**

* **Why Use**:

  * **Best performance**
  * High-quality SQL from natural language
  * Supports LangChain, semantic search, etc.
* **Why Not**:

  * **Requires paid billing**
  * API key won't work until you add a credit card

❌ **Not usable in free tier** — skip for now
